Select * FROM
(SELECT T.city_id, C.name, T.date, T.value
FROM temperature T, city C
WHERE T.city_id=C.id

V2.0 (No alias)
Select * FROM
(SELECT temperature.city_id, city.name, temperature.date, temperature.value

V3.0 JOINING COUNTY, CITY AND TEMPERATURE
Select * FROM
(SELECT temperature.city_id, county.id AS countyID, county.name AS nameCounty, city.name, temperature.date, temperature.value
FROM temperature, city, county
WHERE temperature.city_id=city.id
AND city.county_id=county.id

// FOR BOTH MIN AND MAX:

V4.0
#Nr Cities per County:
SELECT county.id, county.name countyName, COUNT(*) nrCities
FROM county
INNER JOIN city ON county.id=city.county_id
GROUP BY county.name;

#Cities with no counties assigned:
SELECT city.id, city.name, county.name countyNAME
FROM county RIGHT JOIN city ON county.id=city.county_id WHERE city.county_id IS NULL;

#Counties with no cities assgined:
SELECT county.id, county.name countyNAME, city.name
FROM county LEFT JOIN city ON county.id=city.county_id;

#Counties with more than two cities:
SELECT county.id, county.name countyName, COUNT(*) nrCities
FROM county RIGHT JOIN city ON county.id=city.county_id
GROUP BY county.name HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2 AND countyName IS NOT NULL;


V5.0 GROUP BY with different behaviour 

SELECT * FROM (SELECT *,MAX(T.TEMP) AS MAX_TEMP FROM (SELECT county.name AS County, city.name AS CITY,temperature.date AS DATE,temperature.value AS TEMP FROM city, county, temperature WHERE city.id = temperature.city_id AND county.id = city.county_id ORDER BY temperature.value DESC) AS T GROUP BY T.County,T.CITY,T.DATE,T.TEMP ORDER BY T.TEMP DESC) AS TT GROUP BY TT.County;

MY SOLUTION
SELECT * 
FROM   (SELECT *, 
               Max(T.temp) AS MAX_TEMP 
        FROM   (SELECT county.NAME       AS County, 
                       city.NAME         AS CITY, 
                       temperature.date  AS DATE, 
                       temperature.value AS TEMP 
                FROM   city, 
                       county, 
                       temperature 
                WHERE  city.id = temperature.city_id 
                       AND county.id = city.county_id 
                ORDER  BY temperature.value DESC) AS T 
        GROUP  BY T.county, 
                  T.city, 
                  T.date, 
                  T.temp 
        ORDER  BY T.temp DESC) AS TT 
GROUP  BY TT.county; 


MAX SOLUTION:
select t1.*, t2.* from temperature as t1 inner join (select county_id, max(value) as max_value from temperature group by county_id) as t2 on t1.county_id = t2.county_id where t1.value = t2.max_value;
